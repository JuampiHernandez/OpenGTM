# Worker slots and enrichment concurrency

Workbook enrichment concurrency is bounded at four nested levels. Each level
caps a different resource, and the effective parallelism is the *minimum*
along the path, not the product. This page lists every knob, its default, what
it bounds, and how to tune it. Measure changes with the
[enrichment completion harness](#measuring-with-the-enrichment-harness).

```
replicas x WORKER_CONCURRENCY slots            (durable jobs at once)
  └─ capped per tenant by WORKER_MAX_ACTIVE_PER_WORKSPACE
     └─ one killable job child per slot         (run_workbook)
        └─ row_concurrency rows per batch       (asyncio, one DB session per cell)
           └─ provider_workers pebble processes (killable provider calls)
```

## Durable queue (per worker process)

| Setting | Default | Range | Bounds |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `WORKER_CONCURRENCY` | `1` | 1-64 | Claim slots per worker process (the in-API worker or each `python -m apps.api.worker` replica). Each slot claims one job and runs it in its own killable child process (`apps.api.job_process`). Total job parallelism is `replicas x WORKER_CONCURRENCY`. |
| `WORKER_MAX_ACTIVE_PER_WORKSPACE` | `2` | 0-64 (0 disables) | Jobs one workspace may have in `processing` at once, across all replicas. PostgreSQL enforces it with a per-workspace advisory lock during the claim; global jobs (no workspace) are uncapped. This is the tenant-fairness bound. |
| `WORKER_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_SECONDS` | `30` | 0-300 | How long shutdown drains active slots before cancelling (and killing) their job children. |
| `RUN_INLINE_WORKER` | `1` | `0`/`1` | Whether the API process also runs a worker. Set `0` when standalone worker replicas own processing. |
| `run_workbook` timeout | 1800 s | code (`JOB_TIMEOUTS`) | Wall-clock limit on one enrichment job; the child is killed on expiry. |
| Heartbeat interval | 30 s | code | Lease renewal; dead-worker reaping uses it. |

A single `run_workbook` job occupies one slot for its whole run, so raising
`WORKER_CONCURRENCY` speeds up *several* workbooks (or tenants) running at once,
not one large workbook. With the default of one slot, a second workbook waits
until the first finishes.

## Per-run enrichment settings (Settings -> Enrichment performance)

These are stored in the settings database as `ENRICH_<KEY>` (set them in the UI
or with `PUT /api/settings/enrichment-perf`, admin only). The API snapshots them
into each `run_workbook` job payload at enqueue time, so a change affects the
next run, not one already queued.

| Setting | Default | Range | Bounds |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `row_concurrency` | `12` | 1-64 | Rows enriched concurrently inside one job. Rows run in batches of this size and each batch waits for its slowest row before the next starts. Each in-flight cell holds one database session. |
| `provider_workers` | `8` | 1-64 | Size of the pebble process pool for provider calls inside one job child. Caps concurrent provider calls per job; a hung call costs one killed process, not the run. |
| `provider_timeout` | `10` s | 3-120 | Per provider call; the provider process is killed when it expires. |
| `max_providers` | `8` | 0-20 (0 = full chain) | Waterfall depth per cell. |
| `retry_passes` | `1` | 0-5 | Extra passes over cells still in `error` after the main pass. |

Environment fallbacks used when a payload or the settings database lacks a
value: `WORKBOOK_RUN_CONCURRENCY` (12), `WORKBOOK_PROVIDER_WORKERS` (8),
`WORKBOOK_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT` (10), `WORKBOOK_MAX_PROVIDERS_PER_CELL` (0).

## Database connection pools (per process)

Every job child creates its own SQLAlchemy engine:

| Backend | Pool |
| --- | --- |
| SQLite | SQLAlchemy default `QueuePool`: 5 connections + 10 overflow, 30 s checkout timeout |
| PostgreSQL | `pool_size=10`, `max_overflow=20` (30 connections), 30 s checkout timeout |

PostgreSQL `max_connections` must cover
`replicas x (1 + WORKER_CONCURRENCY x per-child pool)` plus the API.

## Tuning

1. **Keep `row_concurrency` below the job child's pool capacity**: at most 12
   on SQLite (15 connections) and about 25 on PostgreSQL (30 connections).
   Cells keep their session open across the provider call, and a checkout
   that has to wait blocks the event loop of the job child. Every in-flight
   cell then stalls until the 30 s pool timeout fires. The M0 harness
   reproduced this: `row_concurrency=32` on SQLite finished 14 cells in about
   ten minutes. The Settings UI currently allows up to 64. Track this as a
   bug; do not tune around it.
2. **Match `provider_workers` to `row_concurrency`** for single-provider
   columns. A provider call is the only work that uses the pool, so with
   `provider_workers < row_concurrency` part of each batch queues behind the
   rest. Each provider worker is a full Python process (about 100-160 MB RSS),
   so per host memory is roughly
   `replicas x WORKER_CONCURRENCY x provider_workers` processes.
3. **Raise `WORKER_CONCURRENCY`** when several workbooks or tenants run at
   once. Keep `WORKER_MAX_ACTIVE_PER_WORKSPACE` below it so one tenant cannot
   take every slot.
4. **Use PostgreSQL** for concurrent writers. SQLite serializes writes and is a
   development backend.
5. Re-measure after every change with the same harness parameters and record
   the identity block next to the result.

## Measuring with the enrichment harness

`scripts/bench/enrichment_harness.py` runs the real path: durable queue claim,
`run_workbook` job child, declarative HTTP provider in the pebble pool, and
result commit. Calls go to a deterministic local provider simulator
(`scripts/bench/provider_simulator.py`).

```bash
# Shipped defaults, 500 rows, fixed 50 ms provider latency, temp SQLite
uv run python scripts/bench/enrichment_harness.py --rows 500 --latency-ms 50 \
  --output artifacts/bench/enrichment-500.json

# Fault mix: lognormal latency, 1% 5xx, 2% 429, fixed seed
uv run python scripts/bench/enrichment_harness.py --rows 2000 --latency-ms 50 \
  --latency-dist lognormal --sigma 0.5 --error-rate 0.01 --rate-429 0.02 --seed 42

# Override any knob (defaults are the shipped values above)
uv run python scripts/bench/enrichment_harness.py --rows 2000 --workbooks 4 \
  --workspaces 2 --worker-concurrency 4 --row-concurrency 12 --provider-workers 12

# PostgreSQL: a disposable, migrated database only
BENCH_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://.../opengtm_bench \
  uv run python scripts/bench/enrichment_harness.py --rows 2000
```

The report (`--output` writes JSON, `--json` prints it) includes:

- **Results:** committed completions/sec (from enqueue, and excluding the
  job-start overhead); end-to-end latency per cell (enqueue to result commit)
  and cell execution latency at p50/p95/p99; startup time to the first cell;
  cell status and error counts; job statuses; simulator request and status
  counts (provider attempts, 429s, 5xx); approximate CPU and peak RSS.
- **Identity block:** git commit and dirty flag; CPU model, cores, RAM, and OS;
  Python version; database dialect and version; Redis reachability; every
  worker and enrichment setting above; workload parameters (rows, workbooks,
  workspaces, simulator latency, error rates, and seed).

How it works and what it changes:

- Simulator outcomes are a pure function of `(seed, row domain, attempt)`, so
  identical parameters produce the same provider behavior regardless of
  scheduling.
- Benchmark processes load `scripts/bench/_shim/sitecustomize.py` through
  `PYTHONPATH`. It makes three changes: it exempts exactly the simulator's
  loopback origin from the SSRF guard (any other URL is still checked), it
  registers the generated manifest through the normal compile/register path,
  and it records per-cell timings. It refuses any non-loopback origin. None of
  this ships in the application.
- With the default temporary SQLite database, nothing persists. With a
  supplied database, the harness refuses to start if other jobs are
  pending/processing. It claims only its own fire-key-tagged jobs and deletes
  only the rows it created.
- The email verify cascade is disabled on the benchmark column (it would
  measure live DNS/SMTP). Pass `--cost-per-lookup` > 0 to route calls through
  the spend-reservation path.
- `kill -USR1 <job child pid>` dumps all thread stacks of a stalled benchmark
  process to stderr.

claims; see [benchmarks/enrichment-baseline.md](../benchmarks/enrichment-baseline.md).
